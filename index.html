        <p>Skill or competency? This is a great question. How are we to know the difference?
        The biggest issue is defining these terms in a way that does not require physical proof. What do I mean?
        I mean that there is some level of mathematical justification that can be used to acknowldge the apriory of
        the definition written down. The only way to do this is mathematically, to satisfy a human's need for specification.
        
        Need, or want, further clarification? Consider someone explaining you a mathematical concept. And then you simply say,
        "I do not believe you." What is the person explaining the concept to do(bear with me I will connect back to my point,
        I will need to illustrate this)? They could simply state that the listener, student, does not possess the ability to
        understand. But then the student may claim that the teacher does not posess the understanding to explain. This issue
        be exacerbated until there is some precise definition presented, either by the teacher, or student.
        
        This precise definition may be manifested(proven) in many ways. When considering this manifestation of "proof" we might
        want to consider what is neccesary to present it: What skill? What competance?
        
        While I will not be providing resolution to this I am trying to point towards the issue at hand.
        
        I want to go on the record of stating that skills  and competancy have nothing to do with attitude or person disposition.
        This is the notion of judgement coming in and there is a slipper slope towrds of less palatable aspects of the profession
        of educator: racism, stereotypes, etc.
        
        To avoid the appearance of such things we need precise definitions, mathematical in nature, of skills and competencies.
        Otherwise you will get people running rampant with the ability to "muddy the water" of the discussion to "cover their
        misconceptions". This is a natural self-preservation technique for all creatures, we might...(finish)

        <p>I will be competing in May and hope to have times that are competitive by then... under 10 seconds? <br>Rational trig and chromogeometry to univesal geometry will be required.<br> Will I be able to prove my understanding of these topics?</p>
